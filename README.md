# blackbox

Single daemon for AI dev tooling: full-text search across Claude Code / Codex / Copilot / Vibe / Gemini transcripts, a unified knowledge store rendered into each provider's markdown files, work-thread tracking, and multi-provider agent orchestration with a live multi-lane tail TUI. Backed by [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) (Rust, BM25 ranking). Sub-50ms queries over hundreds of thousands of indexed documents.

The crate is `blackbox`. It produces two binaries:
- **`blackboxd`** — HTTP-MCP daemon (one long-lived user service, shared across all CLIs on the host)
- **`bro`** — terminal TUI for tailing live orchestration activity

---

## Quick start

Five steps. After step 5 every agent CLI on your host is talking to the same daemon, your existing `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` content has been absorbed into one store, and the store is rendered back out to each provider in a consistent layered form.

### 1. Build and install the binaries

```bash
git clone https://github.com/invidious9000/transcript-search.git
cd transcript-search
cargo build --release
install -m 755 target/release/blackboxd ~/.local/bin/
install -m 755 target/release/bro       ~/.local/bin/
```

### 2. Run `blackboxd` as a systemd user service

```bash
cp deploy/blackbox.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now blackbox.service
```

One daemon serves every Claude / Codex / Gemini / Copilot / Vibe CLI on the host, so they all share the same tantivy index, knowledge store, and orchestration state. Upgrades: rebuild, `install` (atomic), `systemctl --user restart blackbox`.

Logs live in journald:
```bash
journalctl --user -u blackbox -f
```

### 3. Connect your CLIs

The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:7264/mcp` by default. Point every agent CLI at the same URL.

**Claude Code** — `~/.claude*/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blackbox": { "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7264/mcp" }
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** — `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.blackbox]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:7264/mcp"
```

Restart each CLI. The first transcript search will auto-build the index (1–3 minutes depending on corpus size).

### 4. Bootstrap your first project

`bbox_bootstrap` scans an existing repo's instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `PROJECT.md`, any headings it can identify) and migrates them into the unified knowledge store as discrete entries, preserving scope (global vs project) and category.

From any connected CLI, run the MCP tool directly — for example in Claude Code:

```
bbox_bootstrap(project: "/home/you/repos/my-app")
```

Review the imports with `bbox_knowledge` or `bbox_review` (new entries land as `unverified` until you approve them).

### 5. Render the store back out

Rewrite the provider instruction files from the canonical store so every agent sees the same three-layer content (steerage → shared memory → project-specific):

```
bbox_render(scope: "both", project: "/home/you/repos/my-app")
```

- **`scope=global`** — patches `~/.claude-shared/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` between `<!-- bb:managed-start -->` / `<!-- bb:managed-end -->` markers. User-authored content outside the markers (including RTK `@imports`) is preserved. Originals snapshot to `~/.local/state/blackbox/backups/<ISO-ts>/` before every write.
- **`scope=project`** — writes `<repo>/{CLAUDE,AGENTS,GEMINI}.md` with **only** project-scope entries + verbatim `PROJECT.md` content. Global entries aren't duplicated per project.
- **`scope=both`** — both. Useful on first install or for a forced re-sync.

From this point on: `bbox_learn` / `bbox_remember` to add or update, `bbox_render` to push changes out to provider files, `bbox_absorb` to pull external edits back in. See [Knowledge lifecycle](#knowledge-lifecycle) below for the full loop.

---

## Knowledge lifecycle

Blackbox treats your provider instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) as *rendered outputs* of a single canonical store — not as sources of truth. This lets every agent on the host see consistent content, lets you edit in any file and have it reconciled, and keeps provider-specific quirks (Copilot's greedy reading, Gemini's unsupported global memory) handled in one place.

```

   bbox_remember                    (diff-based)

```

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| **`bbox_bootstrap`** | New repo — scan existing instruction files and import as entries. Run once per repo. |
| **`bbox_learn`** | Add or update an entry. Entry will be rendered into provider markdown on next `bbox_render`. |
| **`bbox_remember`** | Store an on-demand fact. **NOT rendered** into markdown — searchable via `bbox_knowledge` only. |
| **`bbox_knowledge`** | List / search entries with category / scope / provider filters. |
| **`bbox_render`** | Emit the canonical store back to provider instruction files (global / project / both). |
| **`bbox_absorb`** | Detect external edits to rendered files and import them as unverified entries. |
| **`bbox_review`** | Approve or reject unverified entries (from bootstrap or absorb). |
| **`bbox_forget`** | Remove or supersede an entry. |
| **`bbox_lint`** | Health check: contradictions, stale entries, duplicates. |

`bbox_render` is the write step; without it, changes stay in the store and don't reach your agents. `bbox_absorb` is the inverse — handy after you've edited a `CLAUDE.md` directly and want the change captured before a later render overwrites it.

---

## `bro tail` — multi-lane orchestration TUI

Live tail one or more bros (named agent instances) side-by-side:

```bash
bro tail alice bob                  # two specific bros
bro tail --team review-panel        # every member of a team
bro tail --provider codex           # all codex bros across all teams
```

Each lane seeds from the bro's session JSONL on disk, then follows it live. Displayed per event:
- Assistant / user / developer text — markdown rendered, code fences syntax-highlighted via `syntect`.
- Thinking blocks — italicized.
- Tool use — name + extracted target (Bash→command, Read/Edit/Write→path, Grep→pattern, etc.).
- Tool result — size, exit code (when present), preview, error-state color.
- System signals — session init, compaction, hooks, system-reminders, slash commands — rendered as inline dividers so you can see *why* an agent shifted.

**Keybindings:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle selected lane |
| `f` | Fullscreen toggle on selected lane |
| `↑`/`↓` or `k`/`j` | Scroll 1 line |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn` | Scroll one page |
| `g` / `Home` | Jump to top |
| `G` / `End` | Jump to bottom (live mode) |
| `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` | Quit |

**Mouse:**

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Click lane body | Sets that lane as selected |
| Click + drag on divider | Resize adjacent lanes (±1 col detection, 12-col minimum) |
| Wheel up/down | Scrolls lane under cursor (no Tab required) |

Footer per lane shows `● LIVE` or `⏸ -N` when scrolled up, plus running counts (text / tool / thinking / signal events). Scroll position stays anchored to content when new events arrive.

Five providers at parity: Claude (`.jsonl`), Codex (`.jsonl`), Gemini (`.json` single-object), Copilot (`session-state/<id>/events.jsonl`), Vibe (`logs/session/.../messages.jsonl`).

| `bbox_thread_list` | List / scan threads (open / active / stale by default). |

### Multi-provider orchestration (`bro_*`)

Dispatch agent tasks to Claude, Codex, Copilot, Vibe, or Gemini and coordinate them as teams.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `bro_exec` | Launch an agent task. Returns `{taskId, sessionId}` immediately. |
| `bro_resume` | Resume a previous agent session with a follow-up prompt. |
| `bro_wait` / `bro_when_all` / `bro_when_any` | Block until one / all / first task(s) complete. Emits MCP progress notifications (client-echoed `progressToken`) with a multi-lane activity snapshot every 15s. |

### HTTP endpoints (non-MCP)

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /mcp` | MCP streamable-HTTP transport. All client CLIs connect here. |
| `GET /tail` | SSE stream of orchestration lifecycle events. Filter via `?team=`/`?bro=`/`?provider=`. |
| `GET /roster` | Resolves `?bros=a,b&team=X&provider=Y` selectors → `[{bro, team, provider, session_id, jsonl_path, model}]`. Used by `bro tail` to locate transcript files. |

## What gets indexed

| Source | Event type | Index role |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | User messages | `user` |
| Claude Code | Assistant text | `assistant` |
| Claude Code | Thinking blocks | `thinking` |
| Claude Code | Tool use (name + input) | `tool_use` |
| Claude Code | Tool results | `tool_result` |
| Claude Code | Subagent transcripts | all roles, `is_subagent=1` |
| Codex CLI | User / assistant / developer messages | `user`, `assistant`, `developer` |
| Codex CLI | Function calls | `tool_use` |
| Codex CLI | Function results | `tool_result` |
| Codex CLI | Reasoning blocks | `thinking` |
| Both | Command history | `user` |

Content is capped at 12KB per document. Responses are capped at 80KB to avoid blowing MCP result limits.

`bro tail` reads a richer `TranscriptEvent` model that preserves tool-call structure and out-of-band system signals — the indexer projects that down to the flat `ParsedEvent` shape it needs.

---

## Provider catalog

Maintained in `src/orchestration/providers.rs`:

- **Claude** — Opus 4.7 (default, 1M context built-in), Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5. Effort tiers `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max` (default `xhigh`; `xhigh` is Opus-4.7-only, `max` unsupported on Haiku). Runs with `--include-partial-messages` so progress notifiers see true delta streaming.
- **Codex** — gpt-5.4 family. Efforts `minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`.
- **Copilot** — Anthropic + OpenAI models. Efforts `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`.
- **Vibe**, **Gemini** — model lists only.

---

## Configuration

Auto-detection works out of the box for most setups. Override via environment variables (typically via a systemd unit drop-in — see *Multi-account example* below).

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_ROOTS` | auto-detect `~/.claude` + `~/.claude-*` | Account roots. Format: `name=/path,name2=/path2` |
| `TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_CODEX_ROOT` | `~/.codex` if it exists | Codex CLI data directory |
| `TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_INDEX_PATH` | `~/.claude-shared/transcript-index` or `~/.local/share/blackbox/index` | Tantivy index location |
| `BLACKBOX_REINDEX_INTERVAL_SECS` | `120` | Background reindex interval (seconds) |
| `BBOX_PORT` / `BRO_PORT` | `7264` | HTTP port for MCP + `/tail` + `/roster` endpoints |
| `CLAUDE_BIN` / `CODEX_BIN` / `COPILOT_BIN` / `GEMINI_BIN` / `VIBE_BIN` | from `$PATH` | Override provider binary paths |
| `RUST_LOG` | `blackbox=info` | Tracing filter |

### Auto-detection

By default the server:
1. Always includes `~/.claude` as the `claude` account.
2. Scans `~/` for any `~/.claude-*` directories that contain a `projects/` subdirectory.
3. Includes `~/.codex` if `~/.codex/sessions/` exists.

### Multi-account example

Override account roots via a systemd unit drop-in:

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/blackbox.service.d/accounts.conf
[Service]
Environment=TRANSCRIPT_SEARCH_ROOTS=personal=%h/.claude,work=%h/.claude-work
```
Then `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart blackbox`.

## Transcript schemas (appendix)

**Claude Code** — `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`:
```jsonc
{"type": "user|assistant|system|summary", "message": {...}, "sessionId": "uuid", "timestamp": "ISO-8601", ...}
```

**Codex CLI** — `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl`:
```jsonc
{"timestamp": "ISO-8601", "type": "session_meta|response_item|event_msg", "payload": {...}}
```

**Gemini** — `~/.gemini/tmp/<project>/chats/session-<ts>-<first8>.json` (single JSON object, not JSONL):
```jsonc
{"sessionId": "uuid", "messages": [{"id", "timestamp", "type": "user|gemini", "content", "thoughts": [...], ...}]}
```

**Copilot** — `~/.copilot/session-state/<full-session-id>/events.jsonl`:
```jsonc
{"type": "session.start|user.message|assistant.message|tool.execution_start|tool.execution_complete|...", "data": {...}, "id", "timestamp", "parentId"}
```

**Vibe** — `~/.vibe/logs/session/session_<date>_<time>_<first8>/messages.jsonl`:
```jsonc
{"role": "user|assistant|tool", "content": "...", "tool_calls": [...], "tool_call_id": "...", "message_id": "..."}
```

## Architecture

- **Tantivy** for full-text indexing with BM25 ranking, phrase queries, and positional indexing.
- **Separate documents per content block** — each text / thinking / tool_use block is its own document, enabling role-based filtering and precise excerpts.
- **Incremental indexing** via file mtime/size tracking; background reindex thread runs every 120s.
- **MCP over streamable HTTP** — `rmcp` crate as transport, axum for auxiliary `/tail` and `/roster` endpoints. Progress notifications echo the caller's `progressToken` per spec.
- **Knowledge render pipeline** — three-layer composition (steerage → shared memory → per-project PROJECT.md) into provider-specific markdown, with atomic-replace safety and external-edit absorption.
- **Multi-provider orchestration** — spawns provider CLIs as child processes, streams JSON events, manages task lifecycle, team coordination, and SSE broadcast to `/tail` subscribers.
- **Two-layer transcript model** — `parser::TranscriptEvent` (rich, tool-call structured, system-signal aware) for the `bro tail` TUI; projected to `ParsedEvent` for the flat tantivy doc shape.
- **No LLM calls** — pure local indexing and retrieval. `bbox_topics` uses term frequency, not embeddings.

Source layout (`src/`):

- **main.rs** — `rmcp` server with `#[tool]`-annotated handlers, axum routes for `/tail` / `/roster`, progress-notifier plumbing, signal handling.
- **cli.rs** — `bro` binary. Ratatui TUI with per-lane seed-from-history + live follow, tui-markdown + syntect rendering, crossterm mouse capture.
- **index/** — Tantivy lifecycle, schema, search / browse / session handlers, incremental reindex thread, session-file discovery.
- **parser.rs** — Claude / Codex / Gemini / Copilot / Vibe JSONL parsers emitting both rich `TranscriptEvent` and flat `ParsedEvent`.
- **knowledge.rs**, **render.rs** — Knowledge CRUD and three-layer markdown render pipeline.
- **threads.rs** — Work-thread tracker.
- **orchestration/** — Provider catalogs, exec/resume arg builders, brofile/team persistence, task lifecycle, tail event stream, bro-name ↔ session-id resolution.

---

## Examples

Drop-in configs for wiring blackbox into agent CLIs live in [`examples/`](examples/README.md):

- **Agents** — [`session-searcher`](examples/agents/session-searcher.md): read-only subagent that keeps transcript digging off your main context window.
- **Skills / slash commands** — [`crucible`](examples/skills/crucible.md) (orchestrator + durable implementer + continuous red-team ensemble, coordinated through a `bbox_thread(kind="work_item")` and structured `bbox_note` signals) and [`takeover`](examples/skills/takeover.md) (pick up a stalled or handed-off agent session without losing scope).
