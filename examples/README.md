# Examples

Reference configurations that demonstrate how to wire blackbox (`bbox_*` / `bro_*` MCP tools)
into the CLIs it orchestrates. Copy / adapt into your own project or agent directories — the
daemon doesn't read these files, they're just starting points.

## Agents

Drop-in subagent definitions for Claude Code. Install by copying into
`.claude/agents/` in your repo (project-scoped) or `~/.claude/agents/` (user-scoped).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`agents/session-searcher.md`](agents/session-searcher.md) | Read-only subagent that searches indexed CLI transcripts across every provider / account on the host. Traces rules to their origin turn, summarizes sessions for takeover, audits what another agent did, samples topics across sessions. Scoped so it can only call `bbox_*` readers — never mutates. Use it to keep transcript digging out of your main context window. |

## Skills / Slash Commands

Workflow definitions for Claude Code, invocable as `/user:<name>` (user-scoped) or
`/project:<name>` (project-scoped). Install by copying into `~/.claude/commands/` or
`.claude/commands/` in your repo.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`skills/crucible.md`](skills/crucible.md) | Orchestrator-led implementation workflow. Main-session Claude drives; a durable implementer bro (Opus 4.7 xhigh, held across rounds via `bro_resume`) carries mechanical code context the main session would otherwise lose to compaction; a continuous red-team ensemble (codex + gemini via `red_team` teamplate by default) reviews plan and work product with sustained per-member context. All coordinated through a `bbox_thread(kind="work_item")` and structured `bbox_note` signals (`dispute` / `surprise` / `blocked` / `followup` / `done`) so the orchestrator scans a signal trail instead of parsing prose. Use when context compartmentalization is the primary benefit and cross-provider consensus at bookends is worth the ceremony. |
| [`skills/takeover.md`](skills/takeover.md) | Take over driving an existing agent session. Composes **thread init** (find-or-open a `bbox_thread` with full scope context — handoff docs, source docs, prior takeover notes) and **thread run** (resume the target session via `bro_resume`, drive it iteratively against an authoritative scope checklist until halt conditions are met). Pairs well with the `session-searcher` agent for transcript recon. Use when an agent session stalled, got handed off, or was interrupted mid-work and you need to pick it up without losing scope. |
| [`skills/overmind.md`](skills/overmind.md) | Meta-orchestration — strategic Advisor layer one level above crucible. Main-session Claude holds the arc's charter and a durable **spine doc** (markdown + `bbox_decide` entries); a dispatched orchestrator bro runs crucible internally; ensemble + implementer sit under the orchestrator. Phase 0 is a takeover-style charter dialogue with the user — scope, halt conditions, exit conditions locked upfront. Orchestrator reports at phase boundaries only; Advisor updates the spine doc, records decisions, and steers via `bro_resume`. When the orchestrator compacts or drifts, Advisor retires it and spins a fresh one bootstrapped solely from the spine doc. Use on multi-phase arcs where strategic continuity needs to survive orchestrator compaction. See the recursion note below. |

### Recursion nuance (overmind)

Overmind is one of the rare legitimate uses of `bro_exec(..., allow_recursion=true)`.

By default, the daemon applies a mechanical recursion guard to every dispatched bro: the provider CLI gets filter args at argv construction (`--disallowedTools mcp__blackbox__bro_*` for Claude, equivalent for the other providers) so dispatched bros cannot call `bro_*` tools and can't recurse into nested dispatches. This is on for every `bro_exec` and `bro_resume` unless you explicitly opt out.

Overmind's orchestrator is itself a dispatcher — it runs crucible, which fans out an ensemble via `bro_broadcast` and manages a durable implementer via `bro_exec`/`bro_resume`. It needs the `bro_*` surface available. So the **orchestrator dispatch** uses `allow_recursion=true`:

```
bro_exec(
  bro="overmind-orchestrator",
  prompt=<brief>,
  project_dir=<cwd>,
  allow_recursion=true     // legitimate meta-orchestration exception
)
```

Everything *inside* the orchestrator — the ensemble members it broadcasts to, the implementer it exec's and resumes — gets the default guard like any other bro. Only the single orchestrator dispatch bypasses it.

If you adapt this pattern to your own skill, keep `allow_recursion=true` narrowly scoped — only to the one bro that legitimately needs to dispatch further. Apply it to ensemble members or implementers and you've given a code-writing or review-writing bro the ability to fan out uncontrolled; that's not the pattern.

## Adding your own

PRs welcome. Keep examples self-contained — no references to private / project-specific
tooling, no references to corpora blackbox doesn't actually index. Agents should declare
their tool scope explicitly (`disallowedTools` or equivalent) and state up front which
`bbox_*` / `bro_*` surface they depend on.
