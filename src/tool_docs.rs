pub const WORKFLOW_NOTES: &str = "\
## Create etiquette — check stock before ordering

Before any create/open/save/add action that could duplicate an existing \
object, call the list/get/search variant first to look for an existing \
same-name or same-topic entry. Applies to brofiles (`bro_brofile list`), \
teamplates and teams (`bro_team list_templates` / `list`), MCP servers \
(`bro_mcp list`), work threads (`bbox_thread_list`), and dedupe-sensitive \
knowledge writes (`bbox_knowledge` before `bbox_learn` / `bbox_decide`). \
Reuse or update an existing match instead of creating a duplicate.

## Roles and the core loop

Blackbox supports a two-role workflow across multi-provider dispatch:

- **Orchestrator** (usually the main-session agent). Proposes work, \
deliberates with an ensemble, dispatches to executors, reviews output, \
iterates. Reads `bbox_inbox` at round boundaries. Writes `bbox_decide` \
when a commitment is made. Marks notes `acknowledged` or `addressed` \
via `bbox_note_resolve` as the loop progresses.

- **Executor** (dispatched via `bro_exec` / `bro_broadcast`, or the \
equivalent in a cosession flow). Does the work. Emits `bbox_note` \
records throughout for the 7 kinds. Always emits `kind=done` with a \
one-line acceptance summary before returning — this is the \
orchestrator's primary scan signal.

## Ambient scope block

Every dispatched agent receives a per-turn ambient prefix containing \
pre-bound IDs: `session`, `project`, `bro`, and (when applicable) \
`thread`, `work_item`. Use those IDs in `bbox_note` / `bbox_thread` \
calls rather than reaching back through the transcript to guess. The \
daemon may also auto-fill these fields when you omit them.

## Persistence hierarchy (when to reach for which)

**Rule of thumb:** `bbox_learn` / `bbox_remember` / `bbox_decide` capture \
what the USER told you and should survive future sessions. `bbox_note` \
captures what YOU observed during the current dispatch. Never use \
`bbox_note(kind=learned)` for a user-stated rule — that's `bbox_learn`.

- `bbox_remember` — default. Indexed, grep-able, never rendered. \
Safest choice when unsure.
- `bbox_learn` — rules / conventions that should bind every future \
session. Renders into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md.
- `bbox_decide` — durable commitments with required rationale. Pass \
`supersedes` to reverse a prior decision with an auditable chain.
- `bbox_note` — transient work artifacts during a dispatch. Auto-expires \
from attention views once addressed.

## Work-item threads

For orchestrator-led propose→execute→review→refine loops, open a \
thread with `kind=\"work_item\"`. Pass its ID as `thread_id` to \
`bbox_note` calls so the loop's notes collate automatically. The \
orchestrator can read the full refinement history with \
`bbox_notes(thread_id=...)` instead of re-reading transcripts.

## Dispatch etiquette

- Prefer named bro targeting (`bro: \"executor\"`) over raw provider — \
it resolves provider, account, lens, and sessionId automatically.
- Always use `bro_resume` (not `bro_exec`) for multi-turn conversations. \
`bro_exec` starts fresh with no memory.
- Use maximum timeouts on `bro_wait` / `bro_when_all` / `bro_when_any`.
- For ensembles: `bro_broadcast` then `bro_when_all` (blind deliberation) \
or `bro_when_any` (race).
